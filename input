This Point class has four members the variables x and y and the methods move and toString.
Unlike many other languages, the primary constructor is in the class signature (var x Int, var y Int).
The move method takes two integer arguments and returns the Unit value (), which carries no information.
This corresponds roughly to void in Java-like languages. toString, on the other hand,
does not take any arguments but returns a String value. Since toString overrides toString from AnyRef,
it is tagged with the override keyword.
